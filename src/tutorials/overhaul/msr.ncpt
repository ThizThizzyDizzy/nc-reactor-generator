ltext 1 Neutron sources are placed in the casing (seen behind the levers above)
ltext 1 To turn on a reactor, provide it with fuel, coolant, and a redstone signal to all
ltext 1 neutron sources.
ltext 1 To turn off a reactor, the design must include Neutron Shields, which can be
ltext 1 toggled with a Fission Neutron Shield Manager.

translate 1.5
ltext 1 Fuel is inserted via a Fission Fuel Vessel Port
ltext 1 Each fuel has 4 stats:
ltext 1 Efficiency: The base efficiency of the fuel
ltext 1 Base Heat: The base heat generation of the fuel
ltext 1 Criticality: The amount of neutron flux required to activate a fuel vessel.
ltext 1 Base Time: The time, in ticks, that one bucket of fuel will last in one fuel vessel.
ltext 1 Some fuels are also self-priming, so they do not require neutron sources.

ltext 1 Every Fission reactor contains Fuel Vessels, Moderators, and Heaters.

text 1.5 Fuel Vessels
translate 1.5
ltext 1 Each fuel vessel can have a different fuel. To filter a fuel vessel or port, right
ltext 1 click it with a fuel bucket (filtered vessels are accessed through filtered ports)
translate .5
ltext 1 When multiple fuel vessels with the same fuel are adjacent, they combine to form a
ltext 1 vessel group (or "vessel bunch").
ltext 1 A vessel group's Bunching Factor is equal to 6*n/sA, where n is the number of
ltext 1 vessels, and sA is the surface area of the vessel group.
ltext 1 A vessel group's Surface Factor is equal to o/6.
ltext 1 Both of these are rounded down to the nearest whole number.
ltext .75 (These are used later for some calculations)
translate .5
ltext 1 Fuel vessels must be activated for the reactor to start. They are activated when
ltext 1 they receive enough neutron flux. (when flux >= criticality). A vessel group's
ltext 1 criticality is the fuel's criticality multiplied by the number of vessels.
translate 1
ltext 1 Neutron flux spreads through the reactor's core through moderator lines.
ltext 1 Neutron flux originates from vessels that are primed with a neutron source. To
ltext 1 prime a vessel, place a neutron source on the casing with line-of-sight to the
ltext 1 vessel you want to prime. (Line-of-sight is obstructed by vessels, reflectors, and
ltext 1 irradiators, but not by heaters, moderators, or conductors)
ltext 1 You can also prime a cell in the planner by shift-clicking it.

ltext 1 Once a vessel group is activated, it will transmit neutron flux through all connected
ltext 1 moderator lines. Vessel groups will not stay active unless they have enough sustained
ltext 1 neutron flux from other active vessel groups.
ltext 1 Vessel groups gain a heat multiplier and efficiency multiplier from all connected
ltext 1 moderator lines. The heat multiplier is equal to the number of adjacent moderator lines
ltext 1 divided by the number of vessels, while the positional efficiency is the sum of each
ltext 1 line's average efficiency divided by the number of vessels. The total efficiency
ltext 1 multiplier is the positional efficiency multiplied by fuel efficiency.

ltext 1 Reflectors will reflect neutron flux back to vessels through moderator lines.

ltext 1 Moderator lines to reflectors can only be 2 blocks long, as the neutron flux is
ltext 1 traveling to the reflector, then back (a total of 4 blocks)
ltext 1 The Neutron flux of these moderators is also doubled for the same reason.
ltext 1 The moderator line's neutron flux is then multiplied by the reflector's reflectivity.

ltext 1 Irradiators are placed in a reactor to perform recipes using neutron flux.
ltext 1 Irradiators are placed at the end of a moderator line. Each irradiator recipe
ltext 1 requires a specific amount of neutrons, so more neutron flux will speed up the
ltext 1 recipes. (although one moderator is enough for a very slow irradiator)

ltext 1 Heaters can also form moderator lines, and will act as a moderator with a flux
